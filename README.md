# Overhead-Localisation

- The enemy robot and itâ€™s position through the overhead camera was identified.
- Customised AR tags placed on the obstacles were detected using ORB transform and computer vision techniques .
- Perspective transform matrix with the coordinates of the AR tags in the frame and the coordinates of the AR tags in the officially given orthographic view of the arena was calculated.
- Position of the enemy robot through the calculated matrix was predicted.
